# Migration guide

Check out the [command line reference](./cli.md) for usage information.

Although this tool tries its best, it isn't magic and can not refactor everything automatically. 

Nevertheless it will inform you about every failed or problematic replacement and additionally to that, here are some tips you should consider when migrating your codebase.

## Manual inspection

Every change generated by ui5-migration should be inspected by a human, as there might be problems which can not be solved automatically:

### Check for module parameter names like `log0`

The tools tries do not overwrite existing variable names. Thus it adds a counter to the name, to make it unique. Sometimes this is due to a shortcut in the old code e.g. `var log = jQuery.sap.log`. Eventhough this shortcut isn't needed anymore, the tool does not remove the variable and thus a rather useless shortcut like `var log = log0` remains.

### Check the JSDoc comments

Sometimes there are `@see` or `@link` references to the old modules like `jquery.sap.log`. These are not changed, as to not mess with the comments.

### Run eslint after migration

Even though the functionality shouldn't break after migration (at least with the `replaceGlobals` module), it is not guaranteed to generate eslint-compliant code. Especially more complex rules like nested ternary expressions or extra binds might be violated.

### Remove commented import parameters

You might have some modules with comments in the `sap.ui.define` call, e.g.

```JavaScript
], function(
    Device,
    Control,
    ShellLayoutRenderer
    /* , jQueryDom, jQueryScript */,
    containsOrEquals,
) {
```

The corresponding dependencies might not exist, or are in different order, so you would have to modify these comments accordingly.
